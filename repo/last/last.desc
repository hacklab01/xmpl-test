#last
searches  back  through the file /var/log/wtmp (or the file designated by the -f flag) and displays a list of all users logged in (and out) since that file was created.  Names of users and tty's can be given, in which case last will show only those entries matching the arguments.   Names  of  ttys  can  be abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as last tty0
